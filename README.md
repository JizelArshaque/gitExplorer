<!-- OVERVIEW -->

This Angular application aims to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing GitHub user profiles and their repositories. Here's a brief of the application:

Profile Page:

The application dynamically generates user profile pages based on the GitHub username provided via URL parameters. This ensures that each user's profile is displayed accurately.
The profile page displays basic information about the GitHub user, including their name, avatar, bio, and the number of repositories they have. 

Repository List:

This component fetches and displays a list of repositories belonging to the GitHub user whose profile is being viewed.
Each repository is represented by a card, which includes repository name, description, and a list of topics.
